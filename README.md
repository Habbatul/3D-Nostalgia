## About 📺

A three-dimensional website with a digital nostalgia theme for Gen Z, featuring a lonely and liminal atmosphere. This website is created as an exploration of WebGL using Three.js. My exploration involves basic trigonometry, shaders, application of GLTF and HDRI, the combination of WebGL-Three.js with JavaScript event handlers, and more.
