## About <a name="#about"></a>

A three-dimensional website with a digital nostalgia theme for Gen Z, featuring a lonely and liminal atmosphere. This website is created as an exploration of WebGL using Three.js. My exploration involves basic trigonometry, shaders, application of GLTF and HDRI, the combination of WebGL-Three.js with JavaScript event handlers, and more.

## Tech Stack <a name="#stack"></a>

My focus is on exploring vanilla JavaScript and implementing trigonometry. Basically, Three.js provides everything we need.

I'm not sure you would want to contribute to this project because even reading it would give you a headache 😂. It's a very bad procedural paradigm, and I might not even understand my own code in a few years, lol 😂.

I've been a Java programmer who deals with those annoying practices every day (clean code, OOP, etc). By not adhering to those foolish practices, I can make programming a refreshing hobby and achieve freedom unbound by the lousy standards and conventions of the industry.
